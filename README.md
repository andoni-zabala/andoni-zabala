👋🏽 I’m Andoni Zabala and here you can find a short introduction about me. I hope you’ll find it useful in case we need to work together.

- 🇦🇷 I’m from Argentina but I really suck at playing fútbol / soccer though I do my best when playing as a defender.
- :books: In my free time you can usually find me reading about crypto or random things through Reddit.


💎 Strong opinions

    Communication is key for success, we should always be on the same page.
    “Done” is better than “Perfect”… but we should always try to know what “Perfect” looks like.
    There’s one way to write down dates: YYYY-MM-DD.


⚙️ Things you’ll see me doing:

    Keeping track of what needs to be done to achieve the common goal.
    Performing code reviews, I believe this is the best way to learn from other developers.
    Achieving small steps towards the goal: I like to keep changes small, easy to explain and undo.
    Understanding how things work and how to improve them.
    Keeping readability, code quality and good typedness as high as possible.
    Trying to downsize (be it code, documentation, processes, slack channels, etc.)
    Keeping an eye on any changes to our codebase.
